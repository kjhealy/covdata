Not all measures are reported by all states.
The \code{positive}, \code{negative}, \code{death}, \code{death_confirmed}, \code{probable_cases} and \code{death_probable} measures are \emph{cumulative} counts.
\code{death_confirmed} is the total number deaths of individuals with COVID-19 infection confirmed by a laboratory test.
In states where the information is available, it tracks only those laboratory-confirmed deaths where COVID also contributed
to the death according to the death certificate. \code{death_probable} is the total number of deaths where COVID was listed as a
cause of death and there is not a laboratory test confirming COVID-19 infection.
